# Recent Predicted Events
This is an assignment for Mobile Web Design & Development (67-240). The theme was based on our own interests so I created this website as a result of the first individual assignment.
I was inspired by YouTuber [Mr & Mrs Gao](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMUnInmOkrWN4gof9KlhNmQ/about). They always make interesting videos about aliens, mythology, religion, historical remains and predictions made by people from years to decades ago. Some of the predictions were true and accurate to an extent that directly reflecting the recent events that happened these few years.
For this site, I have organized some of the predictions with much of the informations, related dates, and credible sources for further reading.
