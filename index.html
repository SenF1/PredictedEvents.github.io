  <!-- The theme for this website is on the recent predicted events. 
  I was inspired by YouTuber Mr & Mrs Gao at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMUnInmOkrWN4gof9KlhNmQ/about.
  They always make interesting videos about aliens, mythology, religion, historical remains and 
  predictions made by people range from year to decades. Many of the predictions were true
  and accurate, directly reflecting the recent events that happened these few years.-->
