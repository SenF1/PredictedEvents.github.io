            "Strengthening Global Systems to Prevent and Respond to High-Consequence Biological 
            Threats". Results of the 2021 Nuclear Threat Initiative tabletop exercise in 
            collaboration with the Munich Security Conference". Page 6 of the Nuclear Threat 
            Initiative report states: "In March 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in partnership 
            with the Munich Security Conference, conducted a tabletop exercise on reducing significant 
            biological threats. The exercise virtually tested national and international Addressing gaps 
            in biosecurity and pandemic preparedness architecture and exploring how to improve the ability 
            to prevent and respond to major biological events... The exercise describes a deadly global 
            pandemic scenario involving an unusual monkeypox virus. It appeared in a fictional country 
            called 'Brinia' and spread across the globe within 18 months. Ultimately, the exercise revealed 
            the cause: the outbreak was caused by a terrorist attack using a modification of pathogens.” 
            In the schedule of the exercise, May 15, 2022, is the date of the terrorist attack.</td>

          <td>Hito Ai</td>
          <td>A Japanese TV show called 《Wonder Zone》conducted an experiment on future predictions by 
            hypnotizing a person. The show hypnotized the hostess named Hito Ai. 
            After she was hypnotized, the hypnotist said to her, "You go 30 years 
            future." This show was in 1992, and in 30 years it will be 2022. She 
            closed her eyes and said, "This is Tokyo? Why is there no one on the 
            street? It feels like the city is running, why is there no one on the 
            street?" The host said, "Is it really Tokyo?" She said, "It just feels 
            like a big city, and I'm not sure if it's Tokyo." At that time, they 
            predicted that there might be a massive earthquake 30 years later in Tokyo, 
            but this speculation was overturned at that time. Even if there is a major 
            earthquake in Tokyo, the city will not be empty, only the city will be 
            functioning. This prediction is now believed to be Shanghai, China. 
            A COVID-19 outbreak in the city of Shanghai, China began on February 28, 2022, 
            and ended on August 7, 2022. The outbreak was caused by the Omicron variant 
            and became the most widespread in Shanghai since the pandemic began two years prior.
